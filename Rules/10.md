# 10 Never assume the person before you did a good job

Check back behind the last person, they probably made some mistakes, and that may be where your problems start.

## Sub Rules

### 10.1 You will make mistakes too

Don't be so hard on the last person, you will make mistakes too. Someone else will have to mop up after you in some years, if you are lucky, it will be you doing the mopping.
