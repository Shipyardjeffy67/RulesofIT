# 9 Don't be afraid to promote your value

There's an old adage in IT:

When IT runs smoothly, the boss says "Why are we even paying you?"
When IT is in shambles, the boss says "Why are we even paying you?"

The thought being that management doesn't see the value in IT. And that's true. When you are used to things running well, you may take it for granted. So part of your job is to prove you and your team's value to the company. Produce reports. Document everything. Insist users create tickets. All of that adds up to make sure management and executives know your value.

## Sub Rules

### 9.1 Don't be rude

We all know that without computers modern society wouldn't exist. We all know that it is our skill that keeps those computers running smoothly. Screaming and demanding wont change minds. Bring data and use buzzwords. Speak to managers and execs on their terms and you will get much better results.
