# 17 Nobody buys a company to leave it alone

Companies are purchased for a reason. Sometimes it is because a competitor believes that they can combine their strengths and provide a better service. However, more often than not a company is being bought because value can be extracted. Changes will follow, whether they are good or bad, plan for and expect them.

### 17.1 Private equity spells doom

When a company is bought by a Private equity firm, they are going to expect a rapid return on investment. This means short sighted changes to maximize profitability in the short term. After partner relationships start taking a massive nosedive, they might start reverting changes if you are lucky.
