# 18 Loyalty has to go both ways

Companies want loyal employees, but it needs to be a two way street. If a company isn't showing loyalty back, don't waste your energy being loyal to them.

## Sub Rules

### Loyalty doesn't pay the rent

You might find yourself in a nice job with nice people. Really respected and treated right, but sometimes you need to cover the rent. Don't beat yourself up about finding another job.
