# 1 Users lie, even when they don't mean to

Don't trust what the user said on face value. Their description of the problem will be incorrect. You will spend a lot of time chasing your tail on problems that don't exist. They don't always mean to lie, but if they knew what they needed, they probably wouldn't be coming to you in the first place.

## Sub Rules

### 1.1 When a user says "Everyone", they mean "one or more person"

The scope of the problem is probably not what the user is telling you. Verify it for yourself.
