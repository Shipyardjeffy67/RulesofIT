# Users lie, even when they don't mean to.

Don't trust what the user said on face value. Their description of the problem will be incorrect. You will spend a lot of time chasing your tail on problems that don't exist. They don't always mean to lie, but if they knew what they needed, they probably wouldn't be coming to you in the first place.
