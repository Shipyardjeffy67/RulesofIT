# Rules of Information Technology

Below are the Rules of Information Technology. They are inspired by the Rules of Acquisition. Feel free to do a PR to add new ones, but please also include a rule description page so that others can learn from your wisdom.

1. Users lie, even when they don't mean to.
2. Nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution.
3. When estimating time, add at least 50%.
4. Everyone has a testing environment, some are lucky enough to have a separate production environment.
5. It was DNS.
